 The below implementation was my initial attempts to brute force it using the run(program:) function
 and then to expand the program to see if I could get a formula for z in terms of each of the inputs.
 When that proved to not really work, I analyzed the program and solved it by hand using basically the
 same technique described here: https://github.com/mrphlip/aoc/blob/master/2021/24.md
